# webDevelopment
A repo with examples we made in the web development course at the high school where I studied

It is a repo where I keep the work we did for the Web Design Applications course at Borusan Asım Kocabıyık Vocational and Technical Anatolian High School, where I am studying. I shared it publicly because I thought it might be useful for friends who want to learn new HTML, CSS and JS.
